To start learning **Spring Boot**, a solid understanding of **core Java** and some knowledge of **Spring Framework basics** will be helpful. Here’s a breakdown of the Java and Spring knowledge you’ll need:

### Core Java Knowledge
1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   - Strong grasp of OOP principles (inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction) is essential, as Spring Boot is designed around these principles.

2. **Java Basics**
   - Understanding Java syntax, control structures (loops, conditionals), exception handling, and access modifiers.
   - **Collections Framework**: Familiarity with `List`, `Map`, `Set`, and handling collections efficiently.

3. **Interfaces and Abstract Classes**
   - Since Spring heavily relies on interfaces and abstraction, comfort with these concepts is important.

4. **Java Annotations**
   - Spring Boot relies heavily on annotations for configuration (e.g., `@RestController`, `@Autowired`, `@Service`), so knowledge of annotations is helpful.

5. **Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IoC)**
   - Understanding these concepts conceptually will help you understand how Spring Boot manages dependencies. While Spring Boot simplifies DI, understanding its purpose is crucial.

6. **Java Exception Handling**
   - Spring Boot handles exceptions in controllers and services, so you should be comfortable with Java's `try-catch` syntax, custom exceptions, and Java’s exception hierarchy.

7. **Basic JDBC Knowledge**
   - Understanding the basics of JDBC will help when working with Spring Data JPA or Spring Boot’s data access capabilities.

### Basic Spring Framework Knowledge
1. **Dependency Injection (DI) in Spring**
   - Spring Boot is built on top of the Spring Framework, so understanding how DI works in Spring will help you understand Spring Boot’s component scanning and bean creation.

2. **Spring Annotations**
   - Some basic knowledge of commonly used Spring annotations, such as `@Component`, `@Autowired`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Controller`, will make it easier to understand Spring Boot.

3. **Spring Core Concepts**
   - Concepts like the Spring IoC container and Spring beans are foundational to Spring Boot. Understanding these at a high level is enough to get started.

### Optional, But Helpful Knowledge
1. **Basic REST API Concepts**
   - Since Spring Boot is commonly used to build REST APIs, a basic understanding of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), JSON, and RESTful principles is helpful.

2. **Basic Knowledge of Maven or Gradle**
   - Spring Boot applications often use Maven or Gradle for dependency management and builds, so familiarity with one of these tools will make configuration easier.

### Summary
If you have a **solid grasp of core Java** and some knowledge of **basic Spring concepts**, you’re ready to get started with Spring Boot. Spring Boot simplifies a lot of Spring’s configuration and dependencies, so it’s a great choice for building applications quickly once you’re comfortable with Java fundamentals.
