## A subtree of node in a tree is a tree consisting of node and all of its descendants.
### >  --> All nodes that can be reached by traversing downwards from that node.

### The subtree rooted at a node includes the entire structure beneath that node, preserving the original connections and hierarchy within the tree.

#### Example:
Consider this tree:

       A
      / \
     B   C
    / \
   D   E

> The subtree rooted at B would consist of the node B and all its descendants (D and E), forming the structure:

   B
  / \
 D   E

> The subtree rooted at A is the entire tree itself:

         A
        / \
       B   C
      / \
     D   E

### Each node can be the root of a subtree, which includes everything from that node downward in the original tree structure.
